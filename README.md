## ðŸ“š About

This project is based on a tutorial from the **Complete Python Developer Zero to Mastery course** by Andrei Neagoie (ZTM).  
I refactored and improved the original script by adding modular structure, error handling, configuration constants, and a clear entry point, making it more maintainable and reusable.
